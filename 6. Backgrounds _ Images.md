# Backgrounds & Images (Advanced)

In this file, you will learn about:

- `background` Property
- Images & Background Images
- Gradients
- Filters

## `background` Property

We set a background image with `background` in previous files. But now we want to work with `background-image`, the `background` property is a shorthand property of `background-image` and `background-color` (and other property).

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">

<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Styling</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
</head>

<body>

</body>

</html>
```

```css
body {
  background-color: red;
}

/* or */

body {
  background-image: url("image.png");
}
```

We can set size of that image with `background-size` property; this property takes a couple of different values, for example;

```css
body {
  background-image: url("./Persian\ Sight\ AI.jpg");
  background-size: 100px;
}
```

We see lots of images which are `100px` each of them. We can turn off repeating mode with `background-repeat` property:

```css
body {
  background-image: url("./Persian\ Sight\ AI.jpg");
  background-size: 100px;
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
}
```

We can tell CSS to just repeat in x-axis:

```css
body {
  background-image: url("./Persian\ Sight\ AI.jpg");
  background-size: 100px;
  background-repeat: repeat-x;
}
```

We can also use it as y-axis with `repeat-y`. We want to turn back to the `no-repeat` value.

If we set two values in `background-size`, it will automatically set to `width` and `height`:

```css
body {
  background-image: url("./Persian\ Sight\ AI.jpg");
  background-size: 600px 400px;
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
}

/* width: 600px | height: 400px */
```

**Note**: We can also use `%` percentage for width-height values.

If we use `100%` as value of background image size, it will automatically crop the image for us:

```css
body {
  background-image: url("./Persian\ Sight\ AI.jpg");
  background-size: 100%;
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
}
```

But we want to add whole image in our screen. Instead of manually setting the width and height, we have a predefined keyword which helps us to show an image as cover. That's `cover` value.

```css
body {
  background-image: url("./Persian\ Sight\ AI.jpg");
  background-size: cover;
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
}
```

It exactly the same as `100%`. But it's not exactly doing as `100%`; it sets the width to the container width. Inthe other words, `cover` is setting that will ensure that our image always fills the entire container (with cropped image), for example:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">

<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Styling</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
</head>

<body>
<div></div>
</body>

</html>
```

```css
div {
  width: 100%;
  height: 400px;
  background-image: url("./Persian\ Sight\ AI.jpg");
  background-size: cover;
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
}
```

This value is a great choice if we want to ensure that there never is any whitespace anywhere in our container. An alternative to `cover`, is `contain`. This value (i.e. `contain`) ensures that the full image is visible in the container.

**Note**: `contain` does not make sure that the entire container is filled (like `cover` does), instead it ensures that the entire image is possible.

In the other words:

- `cover`: Focus on covering an image in container and it's also cover an image in whitespaces and doesn't allow that container has some whitespaces.
- `contain`: Focus on showing entire image in container and maybe there is some whitespaces in our container.

For example:

```css
div {
  background-color: red;
  width: 100%;
  height: 400px;
  background-image: url("./Persian\ Sight\ AI.jpg");
  background-size: contain;
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
}
```

There is a red area in our screen with an image because of using `contain` in `background-size` property.

## Working with `background-position`

We can change the position of the image with this property, for example:

```css
div {
  width: 100%;
  height: 400px;
  background-image: url("./Persian\ Sight\ AI.jpg");
  background-size: cover;
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
  background-position: 200px;
}
```

In this style, we push an image to the right by `200px` and it's include the x-axis. If we add a second value, it would be a y-axis value:

```css
div {
  width: 100%;
  height: 400px;
  background-image: url("./Persian\ Sight\ AI.jpg");
  background-size: cover;
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
  background-position: 20px 100px;
}
```

We push an image to the right by `20px` and to the bottom by `100px`. If we use `%` instead of pixels, we have a different result. For example:

```css
div {
  width: 100%;
  height: 400px;
  background-image: url("./Persian\ Sight\ AI.jpg");
  background-size: cover;
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
  background-position: 0% 50%;
}
```

If we reload the page, we see the `50%` of the page (width is not affected). If we use `0% 100%`, everything is cropped at the top of the image:

```css
div {
  width: 100%;
  height: 400px;
  background-image: url("./Persian\ Sight\ AI.jpg");
  background-size: cover;
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
  background-position: 0% 100%;
}
```

and if we use `0% 0%`, everything is cropped at the bottom of the image:

```css
div {
  width: 100%;
  height: 400px;
  background-image: url("./Persian\ Sight\ AI.jpg");
  background-size: cover;
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
  background-position: 0% 0%;
}
```

Because the default position of y-axis is `50%`. These values are confusable; we also have some predefined keywords for `background-position` property like `center`. It's like `50% 50%` for manually setting:

```css
div {
  width: 100%;
  height: 400px;
  background-image: url("./Persian\ Sight\ AI.jpg");
  background-size: cover;
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
  background-position: center;
}
```

This value will cropped on the left and right and top and bottom, so that the center of the image is the center of the container.

We also have `top left` value (i.e. `0% 0%`) for moving the image to top-left of the container:

```css
div {
  width: 100%;
  height: 400px;
  background-image: url("./Persian\ Sight\ AI.jpg");
  background-size: cover;
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
  background-position: top left;
}
```

We can see the left-bottom of the image with `left bottom` value:

```css
div {
  width: 100%;
  height: 400px;
  background-image: url("./Persian\ Sight\ AI.jpg");
  background-size: cover;
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
  background-position: left bottom;
}
```

We can crop the some of the image with this predefined keywords, for example:

```css
div {
  width: 100%;
  height: 400px;
  background-image: url("./Persian\ Sight\ AI.jpg");
  background-size: cover;
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
  background-position: left 20% bottom 34%;
}
```

**Note**: This values you not work day-by-day, but you need to know about them.

## More `background` Properties

- `background-color`: Uses to set solid background color
- `background-image`: Uses to set an image as background
- `background-position`: Allows us to set the initial position
- `background-size`: Sets the size of the background image
- `background-repeat`: Defines how a background images are repeated
- `background-origin`: Allows us to set a background positioning area
- `background-clip`: Defines where the image should be clipped if necessary
- `background-attachment`: Defines how the scrolling will behave inside of that image

Consider this example:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">

<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Styling</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
</head>

<body>
<div></div>
</body>

</html>
```

```css
div {
  width: 100%;
  height: 400px;
  background-image: url("./Persian\ Sight\ AI.jpg");
  background-size: cover;
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
  border: 10px yellow dotted;
  background-clip: padding-box;
}
```

As you can see, the image is inside of the border. If we change it to `background-clip: content-box;`, this clips it before the padding.

**Important**: We don't use these properties anymore and we also don't want to teach these properties.

## Use `background` Shorthand Property in an Advanced Way

Consider this content:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">

<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Styling</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
</head>

<body>
<div></div>
</body>

</html>
```

```css
div {
  width: 100%;
  height: 400px;
  /* background-image: url("./Persian\ Sight\ AI.jpg"); */
  /* background-size: cover; */
  /* background-position: left 12% top 15%; */
  /* background-repeat: no-repeat; */
  /* background-clip: border-box; */
  background: url("./Persian\ Sight\ AI.jpg") left 12% top 15%/cover no-repeat border-box;
}
```

As you can see, we used all of background properties in one `background` property.

## Working with Linear Gradients

Consider this CSS code:

```css
div {
  width: 100%;
  height: 400px;
  background: linear-gradient();
}
```

`linear-gradient` function consists of two parts in the end (we work with other parts in later). The first part (first argument) is the direction of the gradient (default is top to bottom if we omit this argument) and the second part is the color of background (second and third arguments):

```css
div {
  width: 100%;
  height: 400px;
  background: linear-gradient(to bottom, red, blue);
}
```

As you can see, we have an background color with soft colored with red and blue from top to bottom. If we want to change the direction to from left to right, we need to write:

```css
div {
  width: 100%;
  height: 400px;
  background: linear-gradient(to right, red, blue);
}
```

We can also use diagonal direction for gradients, for example:

```css
div {
  width: 100%;
  height: 400px;
  background: linear-gradient(to left bottom, red, blue);
}
```

We can also use degree in direction, for example:

```css
div {
  width: 100%;
  height: 400px;
  background: linear-gradient(70deg, red, blue);
}
```

**Note**: Default is `180deg`, we can reverse that with `0deg`.

Ass we mentioned before, we said we can work with other parts in later, **now is the later**. We can use other colors in our gradient, for example:

```css
div {
  width: 100%;
  height: 400px;
  background: linear-gradient(180deg, red, blue, rebeccapurple, yellow);
}
```

Our website looks awsome if we use `transparent` color, for example:

```css
div {
  width: 100%;
  height: 400px;
  background: linear-gradient(180deg, blue, transparent);
}
```

We can add manually transparent with predefined colors:

```css
div {
  width: 100%;
  height: 400px;
  background: linear-gradient(180deg, blue, rgba(255, 3, 3, 0.5));
}
```

We can control our color in gradients with `%` percent, for example, we want `40%` of the content will yellow and `60%` of the content will red:

```css
div {
  width: 100%;
  height: 400px;
  background: linear-gradient(180deg, yellow 40%, red 60%);
}
```

It's not looks good but you must know how this gradient work.

## Working with Radial Gradients

We worked with linear gradients in previous header; now we want to work with radial gradient (ellipse shape, not circle). For example:

```css
div {
  width: 100%;
  height: 400px;
  /* background: linear-gradient(180deg, yellow 40%, red 60%); */
  background: radial-gradient(red, blue);
}
```

We can change the shape in the first argument. For example we want to change it to the circle shape:

```css
div {
  width: 100%;
  height: 400px;
  background: radial-gradient(circle, red, blue);
}
```

We can change the position of color with `at` attribute, for example:

```css
div {
  width: 100%;
  height: 400px;
  background: radial-gradient(circle at top, red, blue);
}
```

As you can see, the center of the circle is in the top. We can move the center manually with:

```css
div {
  width: 100%;
  height: 400px;
  background: radial-gradient(circle at bottom left, red, blue);
}

/* or */

div {
  width: 100%;
  height: 400px;
  background: radial-gradient(circle at 23% 35%, red, blue);
}
```

The center of the circle pushed to right by 23% and `35%` to the bottom.

We can resize the circle shape with pixels:

```css
div {
  width: 100%;
  height: 400px;
  background: radial-gradient(circle 200px at 23% 35%, red, blue);
}
```

We also have four special values which describe the closest and farthest side and closest and farthest corner, for example:

```css
div {
  width: 100%;
  height: 400px;
  background: radial-gradient(circle closest-side at 23% 35%, red, blue);
}

/* or */

div {
  width: 100%;
  height: 400px;
  background: radial-gradient(circle farthest-side at 23% 35%, red, blue);
}

/* or */

div {
  width: 100%;
  height: 400px;
  background: radial-gradient(circle closest-corner at 23% 35%, red, blue);
}

/* or */

div {
  width: 100%;
  height: 400px;
  background: radial-gradient(circle farthest-corner at 23% 35%, red, blue);
}
```

**Note**: We don't use these values in our projects.

In the last job, we can control our color in radial gradients with `%` percent like linear gradient, for example, we want `40%` of the content will yellow and `60%` of the content will red:

```css
div {
  width: 100%;
  height: 400px;
  background: radial-gradient(circle, yellow 40%, red 60%);
}
```

## Use Multiple Backgrounds

We can use multiple backgrounds with just `background` property, for example:

```css
div {
  width: 100%;
  height: 400px;
  background: linear-gradient(to top, rgba(255, 3, 255, 0.4), transparent),
    url("./Persian\ Sight\ AI.jpg") center/cover;
}
```

In this example, we split our backgrounds with `,` comma. It means that every `,` comma has its own style. In the other words, we have two backgrounds here; first is for linear gradient and second is for `Persian Sight AI` image with position of `center`.

## Working with Filters

Let's clear all styles from our CSS file. The `filter` property allows us to change the visual appearance of an element. Some useful works with `filter` property are blurring, grayscale or changing the contrast.

List of filters are:

- `blur()`: Blures of an element - e.g. `blur(5px)`
- `brightness()`: Brightness of an element - e.g. `brightness(200%)`
- `contrast()`: Setting contrast of an element - e.g. `contrast(200%)`
- `grayscale()`: Changing the gray-ish of an element - e.g. `grayscale(60%)`
- `huerotate()`: Changing the hue of an element - e.g. `hue-rotate(90deg)`
- `invert()`: Reverses the color of an element - e.g. `invert(80%)`
- `opacity()`: Changing the opacity of an element - e.g. `opacity(45%)`
- `saturate()`: Changing the saturate (like soaked with liquid or brush) of an element - e.g. `saturate(500%)`
- `sepia()`: Adds a brown-ish or coffee color to an element - e.g. `sepia(20%)`

For example:

```css
div {
  width: 100%;
  height: 400px;
  background: url("./Persian\ Sight\ AI.jpg") center/cover;
  filter: blur(4px);
}
```

We can add multiple values in one property, for example:

```css
div {
  width: 100%;
  height: 400px;
  background: url("./Persian\ Sight\ AI.jpg") center/cover;
  filter: blur(4px) hue-rotate(35deg) invert(10%);
}
```
