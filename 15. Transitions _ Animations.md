Transitions are built-in animations in CSS which it happens when we style an element with frame by frame.

We can use transitions wiht `transition` property. Consider this content:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">

<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Styling</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
</head>

<body>
    <div class="container">
        <div class="box"></div>
    </div>
</body>

</html>
```

```css
* {
  box-sizing: border-box;
}

body {
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
}

.container {
  margin: 160px auto;
  width: 600px;
  height: 200px;
  border: 1px black solid;
}

.box {
  width: 200px;
  height: 100%;
  background-color: red;
  transform: translateX(400px);
}
```

We moved the box from start to right by `400px` with transformation (i.e. `translateX()` method). We want to animate this happen, we mean that we want to move the red box to the right within (during) two seconds. We can do it with `transition` property:

```css
.box {
  width: 200px;
  height: 100%;
  background-color: red;
  transform: translateX(400px);
  transition: transform 2s;
}
```

We tell CSS that we select the transform and we want accept the animation with this property. If we decide to add multiple selections in our transition, we can separate them with `,`. For example:

```css
.box {
  width: 200px;
  height: 100%;
  background-color: red;
  transform: translateX(400px);
  transition: transform 2s, background-color 1s;
}
```

**Note**: We can also use `ms` (stands for millisecond) instead of `s` (stands for second) in there, for example:

```css
.box {
  width: 200px;
  height: 100%;
  background-color: red;
  transform: translateX(400px);
  transition: transform 2000ms, background-color 1000ms;
}
```

If you pay attention to box animation, you'll see the box goes faster and in the end, it goes slower. We can also change this behavior with `ease` keyword. The default value is `ease`, if we change it to `ease-in`, the action will be reversed. It means that animation starts in slow mode and end with faster mode.

```css
.box {
  width: 200px;
  height: 100%;
  background-color: red;
  transform: translateX(400px);
  transition: transform 2000ms ease-in;
}
```

We can slow mode in both start and end with `ease-in-out` keyword / value.

```css
.box {
  width: 200px;
  height: 100%;
  background-color: red;
  transform: translateX(400px);
  transition: transform 2000ms ease-in-out;
}
```

**Note**: `ease-out` means that starts with faster mode and ends with slow mode.

We can set delay to our transitions, for example, we want to set delay of `1s` for changing the box position:

```css
.box {
  width: 200px;
  height: 100%;
  background-color: red;
  transform: translateX(400px);
  transition: transform 4s 1s;
}
```

## More on Timing Functions

We talk about `ease`, `ease-in` and `ease-out` values, but there are many easing values in CSS which we can use. For example, we can use Yo-Yo mode with `cubic-bezier(0.68, -0.6, 0.32, 1.6)` value:

```css
.box {
  width: 200px;
  height: 100%;
  background-color: red;
  transform: translateX(400px);
  transition: transform 4s 1s cubic-bezier(0.68, -0.6, 0.32, 1.6);
}
```

**Q**: How this function work?

**Answer**: Look at this image:

![timing-function](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/55/CSS3_Ease-out_timing_function_curve.svg/801px-CSS3_Ease-out_timing_function_curve.svg.png)

This is a `ease-out` timing function (start: fast, end: slow); we can find more timing function values in <https://easings.net>. The `cubic-bezier` timing function works like:

![cubic-bezier-gif](https://i7x7p5b7.stackpathcdn.com/codrops/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/bezier-animation.gif)

This is how a cubic bezier curve is created between two points.

There is a powerful tool for `cubic-bezier` timing function in browser developer tools. If we inspect an animated element (with `cubic-bezier`), we see the animation icon near the element (in **Elements** tab). With that, we can customize our transitions easily.

**Important**: If an element has a `display` of `none` and when we want to change it from `none` to `block` and other animations, it can't be animatable and transitionable. But we can use `setTimeout()` function in **JavaScript** to fix this issue, but we don't recommend you to use this approach.

**Note**: Most use case timing functions are `ease`, `ease-in`, `ease-out` and `linear`.

## Transition Non-Shorthand

We just used `transition` shorthand in previous examples. So the `transition` skeleton is:

```css
.box {
  transition: property duration delay timing-function;
}
```

We can separate them like:

```css
.box {
  width: 200px;
  height: 100%;
  background-color: red;
  transform: translateX(400px);
  transition-property: transform;
  transition-duration: 4s;
  transition-delay: 1s;
  transition-timing-function: cubic-bezier(0.68, -0.6, 0.32, 1.6);
}
```

Before we had:

```css
.box {
  width: 200px;
  height: 100%;
  background-color: red;
  transform: translateX(400px);
  transition: transform 4s 1s cubic-bezier(0.68, -0.6, 0.32, 1.6);
}
```

and this `transition` shorthand is very useful and easy.

## Animations

CSS animation is like transition++. We can animate elements with `transition` property. But if we want to more control on those elements, it's very hard to work with `transition`. We may change the behavior of an element in specific keyframes. For example accepting many animations on one single element.

To add animation, we use `@key-frames` keyword and the name which is selected by our own. Then we use two keyframes in there `from` (start) and `to` (end), for example:

```css
@keyframes hamid {
  from {
  }

  to {
  }
}
```

We have `hamid` animation name with two keyframes. If we have this content:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">

<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Styling</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
</head>

<body>
    <div class="container">
        <div class="box"></div>
    </div>
</body>

</html>
```

We want to animate our red box with this animation:

```css
@keyframes hamid {
  from {
    transform: translateX(0);
  }

  to {
    transform: translateX(400px);
  }
}
```

so we can call an animation with `animation` property:

```css
* {
  box-sizing: border-box;
}

body {
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
}

.container {
  margin: 160px auto;
  width: 600px;
  height: 200px;
  border: 1px black solid;
}

.box {
  width: 200px;
  height: 100%;
  background-color: red;
  animation: hamid 200ms;
}

@keyframes hamid {
  from {
    transform: translateX(0);
  }

  to {
    transform: translateX(400px);
  }
}
```

We moved our box to the right (by `400px`) during `200ms`. First of all we add our animation name in `animation` property, then we set duration of that animation.

We can set delay for our animation, for example:

```css
.box {
  width: 200px;
  height: 100%;
  background-color: red;
  animation: hamid 200ms 1s;
}
```

As you can see, our box moved to the left after one second; we can also add more times for iteration. For example we want iterate our animation for more `5` times:

```css
.box {
  width: 200px;
  height: 100%;
  background-color: red;
  animation: hamid 800ms 1s 5;
}
```

**Note**: The iterating count is `5`, we can set infinite loop to our animation; to do that, we need to write `infinite` instead of `5`:

```css
.box {
  width: 200px;
  height: 100%;
  background-color: red;
  animation: hamid 800ms 1s infinite;
}
```

If you pay attention to box animation, you will see that after animation ends, the box goes to the first keyframe (frame). We can change this animation fill mode with `forwards` value:

```css
.box {
  width: 200px;
  height: 100%;
  background-color: red;
  animation: hamid 800ms 1s 2;
  animation-fill-mode: forwards;
}

@keyframes hamid {
  from {
    transform: translateX(0);
  }

  to {
    transform: translateX(400px);
  }
}
```

It means that we saved the last frame state after animation ends (kept the last keyframe). If we use `backwards`, this would be reversed. We can have both of them with `both` value.

**Note**: The default value of fill mode is `none`.

The most interesting part is that we can change the direction of the animation. For example after moving the box to the right, we don't want to this box goes to start immediately after the next iteration, we want smooth animation between start and end (alternate for each animation):

```css
.box {
  width: 200px;
  height: 100%;
  background-color: red;
  animation: hamid 800ms 1s 2 forwards alternate;
}
```

We can reverse the animation with `reverse` (instead of `alternate`). But we don't have a smooth animation here, we can smooth it with `alternate-reverse` value. It means that we have both reversed animation and smooth animation.

The last thing we do is that we can pause and run our animation with `running` and `paused` values:

```css
.box {
  width: 200px;
  height: 100%;
  background-color: red;
  animation: hamid 800ms 1s 4 forwards alternate-reverse paused;
}
```

**Note**: The default value is `running`. It's very helpul for working with **JavaScript**.

## Animation Non-Shorthand

We just used `animation` shorthand in previous examples. So the `animation` skeleton is:

```css
.box {
  animation: name duration timing-function delay iteration-count fill-mode direction play-state
}
```

We can separate them like:

```css
.box {
  width: 200px;
  height: 100%;
  background-color: red;
  animation-name: hamid;
  animation-duration: 1s;
  animation-timing-function: ease-in;
  /* animation-timing-function: cubic-bezier(0.68, -0.6, 0.32, 1.6); */
  /* animation-timing-function: linear; */
  animation-delay: 1s;
  animation-iteration-count: 5;
  animation-direction: alternate;
  animation-fill-mode: forwards;
  animation-play-state: running;
}
```

Before we had:

```css
.box {
  width: 200px;
  height: 100%;
  background-color: red;
  animation: hamid 800ms 1s ease-in 4 forwards alternate-reverse paused;
}
```

and this `animation` shorthand is very useful and easy.

**For Me**: Make sure teach non-shorthand at first.

## Adding Multiple Keyframes and Frame Rate

If you remember the skeleton of `@keyframe`:

```css
@keyframes hamid {
  from {
  }

  to {
  }
}
```

we can use multiple keyframes in there; for that, we need to remove the `from` and `to` notations and put `number%` instead of them, for example:

```css
.box {
  width: 200px;
  height: 100%;
  background-color: red;
  animation: hamid 800ms 1s ease-in 4 forwards alternate;
}

@keyframes hamid {
  0% {
    transform: translateX(0);
  }

  100% {
    transform: translateX(400px);
  }
```

It's exactly as same as previous examples. But we can have more keyframes with `%` percentage, for example:

```css
.box {
  width: 200px;
  height: 100%;
  background-color: red;
  animation: hamid 800ms 4 forwards alternate;
}

@keyframes hamid {
  0% {
    transform: translateX(-400px);
  }

  50% {
    transform: translateX(0);
  }

  100% {
    transform: translateX(800px);
  }
}
```

Or more smoother animation like:

```css
.box {
  position: relative;
  width: 200px;
  height: 100%;
  background-color: red;
  animation: hamid 800ms 2 linear alternate forwards;
}

@keyframes hamid {
  0% {
    transform: translateX(0);
  }

  20% {
    transform: translateX(200px);
  }

  40% {
    transform: translateX(400px);
  }

  60% {
    transform: translateX(600px);
  }

  80% {
    transform: translateX(800px);
  }

  100% {
    transform: translateX(900px);
  }
}
```

We used six keyframes. Then we use `linear` timing function to move smoothly between every frame.

### Frame Rate

We talked about smoothness, we can put keyframes into some segments with `steps()` timing function (alternative to `cubic-bezier`). `steps()` is a timing function that allows us to break an animation or transition into segments, rather than one continuous transition from one state to another. The function takes two parameters:

```css
.selector {
  animation: hamid 1s steps(number-of-steps, direction);
}
```

for example:

```css
.box {
  width: 200px;
  height: 100%;
  background-color: red;
  animation: hamid 800ms steps(2, start) infinite;
}
```

It means that our animation just moves in two frames (frame rate) or steps and the position of step in start of the element position; if we use `steps(2, end)`, it starts in the end of the element point (left side and right side in X axis for example).

If we increase the steps in there, so we have more frame rate here:

```css
.box {
  width: 200px;
  height: 100%;
  background-color: red;
  animation: hamid 800ms steps(1000, start) infinite;
}
```

**Note**: We can't sense more than `1000` fps (most gamers just experienced 170+ fps).

**Important**: Don't use `left`, `right`, `bottom` and `left` properties for animations, because every frames will need to render and it causes high CPU usage. Then you can use `translateX` or `translateY` properties for that, because it just moves around the document flow (like drag and drop event).

## Animation Usage

You can use animation in:

- Forms
- Input
- Hovering on elements
- Practicing
- Scrollbars
- **JavaScript** - `animationstart`, `animationiteration` and `animationend` event listeners
- and much more

We can use `animation` and `transform` properties to make a simple clock:

```

```css

  width: 300px;
  height: 300px;
  border: 1px black solid;
  border-radius: 50%;
}

.circle {
  position: absolute;
  width: 1rem;
  height: 1rem;
  background-color: black;
  border-radius: 50%;
  top: 150px;
  right: 150px;
}

.second {
  position: absolute;
  background-color: green;
  width: 100px;
  height: 5px;
  animation: tick-tock 60s steps(60, end) infinite;
  transform-origin: left;
}

.minute {
  position: absolute;
  background-color: red;
  width: 70px;
  height: 5px;
  animation: tick-tock 3600s steps(60, end) infinite;
  transform-origin: left;
}

@keyframes tick-tock {
  from {
    transform: rotate(0);
  }
  to {
    transform: rotate(360deg);
  }
}
```
