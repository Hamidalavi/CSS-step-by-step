# Responsiveness

In this file, you will learn about:

- Hardware vs Software Pixels
- `viewport` Meta Tag
- `@media` Media Queries

## Hardware (Device) and Software (CSS) Pixels

If we have a old page like:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">

<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
    <title>Styling</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
</head>

<body>
    <section>
        <div class="item"></div>
        <div class="item"></div>
    </section>
</body>

</html>
```

```css
body {
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
}

section {
  position: relative;
  top: 10vh;
  margin: auto;
  width: 50vw;
  background-color: red;
  height: 30vh;
}

section .item {
  position: relative;
  left: 65px;
  background-color: green;
  display: inline-block;
  width: 20vw;
  height: 10px;
}
```

If we launch the browser, we see that container with two items. Then if we go to the DevTools and select the Phone as view, we see the exact thing in our Desktop view.

We can translate the width and height from Desktop to Phone with **viewport `meta` tag**:

```html
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
```

- `name="viewport"`: It targets the viewport browser of any device.
- `content="width=device-width"`: We were able to tell our browser that our device is a smaller device and it should apply this pixel ratio conversion. Otherwise the browser look at the amount of hardware pixels it has, therefore we can't make our website responsive.
- `content="initial-scale=1.0"`: Defines the zoom level that we have (`1.0` is a default value - no zoom is applied)

If we do that, it will be translated hardware pixels to the Phone width and height or software pixel and now we can make our website responsive.

- `content="user-scalable=yes"`: We can allow/reject the screen zooming by users with this value. If this value is `yes`, users have freedom and they can zoom in and zoom out. Otherwise the can't if the value is `no`.
- `content="maximum-scale=value"`: Restricts the maximum zoom level (zoom in) that is available. For example the user can't zoom more than `1.5x` level.
- `content="minimum-scale=value`: Restricts the minimum zoom level (zoom out) that is available.

## Media Queries

We can change design depending on size. We are able to define specific rules based on the width and height and the the property's value.

**Note**: With viewport, we can't change design and layout of the page.

We can set media queries with `@media`, the skeleton of media query is:

```css
@media (condition) {

}
```

It's exactly the same as `if` condition in the programming language.

Consider this example:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">

<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Styling</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
</head>

<body>
    <section></section>
</body>

</html>
```

```css
section {
  width: 100%;
  height: 30vh;
  background-color: red;
}

@media (max-width: 600px) {
  section {
    background-color: blue;
  }
}
```

We said that, when the maximum width of our viewport is equal or smaller than `600px`, the background color of content will be `blue`.

**Note**: In the other words, all devices that have maximum of `600px`.

We can also add multiple media queries; for example:

```css
section {
  width: 100%;
  height: 30vh;
  background-color: red;
}

/* if the width is smaller than 600px */
@media (max-width: 600px) {
  section {
    background-color: blue;
  }
}

/* if the width is higher than 800px */
@media (min-width: 800px) {
  section {
    background-color: yellow;
  }
}
```

If the width of the viewport is smaller than `600px`, the background color of content will be `blue`, and if the width of the viewport is bigger than `800px`, the background color of content will be `yellow`. Otherwise the normal backgroun color is red.

**Important**: Make sure you writing the media queries in smaller to bigger (priority) width. Because CSS styles are parsed top to bottom.

**Note1**: We can write multiple queries with the same condition and properties.

**Note2**: You can see this <https://www.mydevice.io/#compare-devices> link for some device CSS (software) pixels.

**Note3**: For better CSS structure, put media queries at the end of the file. Because other developers can easily see those queries and edit them.

**For Me**: Make sure I bring my students some article and content and teach the responsive.

We can also use the multiple logical `@media` condition (like `if..else if`) with `and` keyword:

```css
section {
  width: 100%;
  height: 30vh;
  background-color: red;
}

@media (min-width: 800px) and (max-width: 1000px) {
  section {
    background-color: orange;
  }
}
```

The content background color is orange when the width is higher than `800px` and less than `1000px`.
