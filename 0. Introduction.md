# An Introduction to Cascading Style Sheets

CSS stands for **cascading style sheets**. That's make our web page look good. CSS is used for styling HTML content. We can add visual effects, shadows, position elements and so on.

**Note**: It turns the boring HTML content to exciting content.

## History

CSS first introduced in 1996 (17 Dec), the version 1 was released in that year; only two years later, we got CSS version 2 (in 1998 - May) which is developed by the W3C. The latest version of CSS is version 3. The earliest CSS 3 drafts were published in June 1999.

**Note1**: We'll never get a CSS version 4, because CSS 3 is divided into several separate documents called **modules**. Each module adds new capabilities or extends features defined in CSS 2, preserving backward compatibility.

**Note2**: You can learn more about CSS modules in wikipedia: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS#:~:text=CSS%20was%20first%20proposed%20by,Tim%20Berners%2DLee%20at%20CERN.&text=Style%20sheets%20have%20existed%20in,style%20sheets%20for%20the%20web.>
