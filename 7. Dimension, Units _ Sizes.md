# Dimension, Units & Sizes

In this file, you will learn about:

- The `%` Percentage
- `min-width` & `max-width` & `min-height` & `max-height` Properties
- `rem` vs `em` Units
- `vw` & `vh` Units
- Centering an Element with `auto`

In previous files we worked with `%` unit, for example:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">

<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Styling</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
</head>

<body>
<div></div>
</body>

</html>
```

```css
div {
  background: url("./Persian\ Sight\ AI.jpg") center;
  width: 100%;
  height: 400px;
}
```

Now we want to work with new units in this file which so-called `rem` (root em) and `em` which refer to the font size and we cover them later in this file.

We also have a viewport height which is `vh` and viewport width which is `vw`.

We can use these values for `font-size`, `padding`, `border`, `margin`, `width`, `height`, `top`, `right`, `bottom` and `left` properties.

**Q**: How is the size calculated for the different units?

**Answer**:

|Absolute Lengths|Viewport Lengths|Font-Relative Lengths|
|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|**px**|**vh**|**rem**|
|cm|vw|**em**|
|mm|vmin|-|
|-|vmax|-|

**Note**: Bold units are important ones.

## The `%` Percentages and Containing Block

Consider this example:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">

<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Styling</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
</head>

<body>
    <div class="parent">
        <div class="child">
            <div class="nested-child"></div>
        </div>
    </div>
</body>

</html>
```

If we set `width: 100%` to `.parent` selector, it covers whole width of the page.

```css
.parent {
  width: 100%;
  height: 400px;
  background: red
}
```

Then if we set `width: 90%` to `.child` selector, it covers `90%` width of the page.

```css
.child {
  width: 90%;
  height: 200px;
  background-color: aqua;
}
```

Finally, if we set `width: 100%` to `.nested-child` selector, it doesn't cover the whole width, instead, `100%` of its parent element which is `.child` element which is just has `90%` of width.

```css
.nested-child {
  width: 100%;
  height: 100px;
  background-color: yellowgreen;
}
```

Every element itself and the parent use `static/relative` position. **That is why we don't get any result if we use `height: 100%`** and we don't get any result; if the ancestor has specific height, the child height is worked too.

There are some different with `position`, for example, for `fixed`, it just focus on viewport (document flow). For `relative` and `static` they are just focus on **content**. For `absolute`, it contains the padding and border and etc too.

Consider this content:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">

<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Styling</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
</head>

<body>
    <div class="parent">
        <div class="child"></div>
    </div>
</body>

</html>
```

We have parent and child element here. If we style them like:

```css
* {
  box-sizing: border-box;
}

body {
  padding: 0;
  margin: 0;
}

.parent {
  position: fixed;
  border: 5px rebeccapurple solid;
  width: 100%;
  height: 400px;
  background: red;
  margin: 10px 10px;
  padding: 10px 10px;
}

.child {
  position: fixed;
  width: 100%;
  height: 200px;
  background-color: aqua;
}

/*
.parent: 1506x170
.child: 1536x100
*/
```

wee see that they are in viewport and nothing happening; and for `absolute` we have:

```css
* {
  box-sizing: border-box;
}

body {
  padding: 0;
  margin: 0;
}

.parent {
  position: absolute;
  border: 5px rebeccapurple solid;
  width: 100%;
  height: 200px;
  background: red;
  margin: 10px 10px;
  padding: 10px 10px;
}

.child {
  position: absolute;
  width: 100%;
  height: 100px;
  background-color: aqua;
}

/*
.parent: 1506x170
.child: 1526x100
*/
```

as you can see, the padding affected to the size of child content. For `relative` and `static` we have:

```css
* {
  box-sizing: border-box;
}

body {
  padding: 0;
  margin: 0;
}

.parent {
  position: relative;
  border: 5px rebeccapurple solid;
  width: 100%;
  height: 200px;
  background: red;
  margin: 10px 10px;
  padding: 10px 10px;
}

.child {
  position: relative;
  width: 100%;
  height: 100px;
  background-color: aqua;
}

/*
.parent: 1506x170
.child: 1506x100
*/
```

and we see that both parent and child have same `width`. Because the child element just gets the content of parent width, **not the padding**.

**Conclusion**:

Viewport: `position: fixed`
Ancestor/Content + Padding: `position: absolute`
Just Ancestor/Content: `position: relative/static`

## Understanding the `min-width` and `max-width` and `min-height` and `max-height` Properties

Consider this example:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">

<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Styling</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
</head>

<body>
    <section>
        <img class="image" src="./Persian Sight AI.jpg" alt="">
    </section>
</body>

</html>
```

If we use this content, we get full image in our page (with scroll bars). We can limit the width of that image with `max-width`, for example:

```css
.image {
  max-width: 500px;
}
```

We can also use other properties to set limit for minimum and maximum size of images.

## Working with `em` Unit

Consider this content:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">

<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Styling</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
</head>

<body>
    <section>
        <p>Hamid Alavi</p>
    </section>
</body>

</html>
```

We used `px` for font size before like:

```css
p {
  font-size: 20px;
}
```

but now we want to work with `em` unit. It's actually `16px` pixel every `1` em unit. But this value is dynamic and based on the browser website. For example:

```css
p {
  font-size: 1em;
}
```

If we see the **Element > Computed** tab in the browser DevTools, we see that the font size of the `p` element is `16px`.

The interesting thing is that if we change the default font in browser, the font will change based on the default size. For example if we set `Very large` as default font size, our `p` element will has `24px` size.

**Note**: `em` is relative to the `font-size` of its direct or nearest parent.

## Working with `rem` Unit

While `em` is relative to the `font-size` of its direct or nearest parent, `rem` is only relative to the `html` (root) `font-size`. For example if we have some content like:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">

<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Styling</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
</head>

<body>
    <section class="section">
        <p>Hamid Alavi</p>
    </section>
</body>

</html>
```

and CSS code like:

```css
body {
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
}

.section {
  font-size: 2em;
}

.section p {
  font-size: 2em;
}
```

We see that the `Hamid Alavi` text is bigger, because `section` element has `2em` or `32px` and we again add `2em` in `p` element have this value is doubled and we have total `64px` in our `p` element. To solve this issue, we can use `rem` unit instead of `em`. It just takes the font size that is set by the browser setting and root element (`html`) and it doesn't see the parent font size (inherited font size):

```css
body {
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
}

.section {
  font-size: 2rem;
}

.section p {
  font-size: 2rem;
}
```

Now you see the real `2rem` or `32px` in `p` element.

**Note**: We recommend you to use `rem` as unit. Because it gives our element font size more flexibility.

**Important1**: You can also use `em` and `rem` for padding and margin, but we don't recommend this way and this is a bad practice. But for width and height you can use `rem`. `94.48rem = full width` and `44.7rem = 100vh` in my monitor.

**Important2**: This unit may not supports in older browsers like IE.

## Working with `vw` & `vh` Units

There are two more units in styling that we use. One for viewport height and one for viewport width and the element is only calculated in viewport (as we see). It looks like we set the `fixed` position. For example consider this content:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">

<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Styling</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
</head>

<body>
    <section class="section">
        <div></div>
    </section>
</body>

</html>
```

If we style the `div` like this:

```css
.section div {
  background-color: red;
  width: 80vw;
  height: 80vh;
}
```

we see that the small red area in there. `80vh` stands for **80% of the viewport width** and `80vh` stands for **80% of the viewport height** and this value is dynamic like `em` and `rem` is font size. It means that if we chnage the window size, we will see that the red area also chnage with the viewport size. To prove our point, if we set them to `100`:

```css
.section div {
  background-color: red;
  width: 100vw;
  height: 100vh;
}
```

We see full screen with red color covered. But we have scroll bars in there; we can remove them (i.e. scroll bars) with removing margin and padding of body:

```css
body {
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
}

.section div {
  background-color: red;
  width: 100vw;
  height: 100vh;
}
```

And we don't have issue with that and these units are great for practicing with them.

**Important**: We can use these units for our background images in our pages.

**Note**: The interesting thing is that if we resize our window page, the scroll bars not append in our page. Because these values (units) are dynamic.

We can limit their size with `vmin` and `vmax` values:

```css
.section {
  background-color: red;
  width: 20vmin;
  height: 80vh;
}
```

These values are good, but we don't use it day-by-day.

## Conclusion

font size (root element): `%`
font size: `em` and `rem`
padding border margin: `em` and `rem` and **pixel**
width and height: `%` and `vw` and `vh`
top right bottom left: `%`

**Note**: Bolded words means that we recommend that unit.

## The `auto` Value

We can easily center our elements with `auto` value, for example:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">

<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Styling</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
</head>

<body>
    <div>Hamid</div>
</body>

</html>
```

```css
body {
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
}

div {
  width: 30%;
  text-align: center;
}
```

As you can see, the `div` has only `30%` width and inr the left-top of the page. We can center this container into center with `margin: auto` which is automatically calculated by the browser:

```css
div {
  width: 30%;
  margin: auto;
  text-align: center;
}
```

Again, as you can see, `div` is in the center of our page. Indeed, the browser see the extended margins and calculate them and it behaves like that our element being in center.

**Imporatant**: `margin: auto` only works for block level elements (e.g. `div`) with an explicitly assigned width.
