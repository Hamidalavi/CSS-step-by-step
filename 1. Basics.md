# The Basics

In this file, you will learn about:

- How to Add CSS to HTML
- Setting up CSS Rules
- Selectors, Properties & Values
- Conflicting Styles
- Combinators
- Combinator Types

There three different ways to add CSS to HTML:

- Inline Style

  We can add inline style by using `style` attribute in tags, for example:

    ```html
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html lang="en">

    <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8">
        <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width,   initial-scale=1.0">
        <title>Styling</title>
    </head>

    <body>
        <h1 style="color: blue">Hamid Alavi</h1> <!-- this line -->
    </body>

    </html>
    ```

  In this example, we use `style` attribute and `color` property. Then we use `blue` as property's value. If we have multiple styles, we can separating them with `;` semi-colon in the same line.

    ```html
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html lang="en">

    <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8">
        <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
        <title>Styling</title>
    </head>

    <body>
        <h1 style="color: blue; background-color: chartreuse;">Hamid Alavi</h1>
    </body>

    </html>
    ```

  **Note**: This approach is not recommended. Because if we create a bigger page with many styles, it will be very hard to understand and read our code or debugging our code.

- Selectors and `style` tag

  We can use alternative way, by using `<style></style>` default HTML tag. We can write CSS rules in there:

    ```html
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html lang="en">

    <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8">
        <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
        <title>Styling</title>
        <style>
          h1 {
            color: blue;
          }
        </style>
    </head>

    <body>
        <h1>Hamid Alavi</h1>
    </body>

    </html>
    ```

  We can't use this way, because we don't point to any element or tag. We can use **selector**, a selector is an additional piece of information that tells CSS to which element in our DOM (inside of our `body` tag). We can add a selector with:

    ```html
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html lang="en">

    <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8">
        <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
        <title>Styling</title>
        <style>
            h1 {
                color: blue;
            }
        </style>
    </head>

    <body>
        <h1>Hamid Alavi</h1>
    </body>

    </html>
    ```

  In this example, we add a `h1` selector and set rules for that (blue text).

  **Note1**: Rule is selector + property + value.

  **Note2**: It's applied for all `h1` tags in our page; if we use `h1` tag ten more time, all ten `h1` texts will be blue-ish.

- External file

  We can import style file from other file which is holds the CSS code. That file must have `.css` extension, because of standing for Cascading Style Sheets. In that file, we can write the CSS rules (selector + property + value).

    ```css
    /* style.css */
    h1 {
    color: blue;
    }
    ```

  If we reload the page, the styles will be gone. Because we don't specify the style file. The HTML file or browser doesn't scan our file system and include every file it finds. We have to explicitly tell it to use the `style.css` file. We do that with `link` tag:

    ```html
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html lang="en">

    <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8">
        <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
        <title>Styling</title>
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css"> <!-- this line -->
    </head>

    <body>
        <h1>Hamid Alavi</h1>
    </body>

    </html>
    ```

  With `rel` set to `stylesheets`, to inform it that we're including a stylesheet here; and then the `href` (i.e. hyper reference) attribute should point to that file.

## Adding CSS Conclusion

The third way is the best one, because:

1. If we use the same stylesheet in multiple pages, the browser can cache the stylesheet and doesn't need to re-download it for every new page (or reloading the page).

2. If We include our styles in the `<head></head>` section, we increase the file size of our HTML file and the browser needs to re-download it.

## Change the Font Style

We can change the font style with `font-family` property:

```css
/* style.css */
h1 {
  color: blue;
  font-family: sans-serif;
}
```

If you go to the Chrome browser setting, in **Appearance** section, you see the `Customize fonts` (Sans-serif font). In that case, the font style is different in our browser and your browser.

**Note**: The defualt font is `Arial` for sans-serif font in browser.

We can import fonts (link and rule) from web; for example, we can import google fonts to our content:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">

<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Styling</title>
    <link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Kirang+Haerang&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
</head>

<body>
    <h1>Hamid Alavi</h1>
</body>

</html>
```

```css
h1 {
  color: blue;
  font-family: 'Kirang Haerang', cursive;
}
```

## Selectors

We have many selectors in HTML, for example, `class`es, `id`s, attributes. We only used element selector (e.g. `h1`) above.

For example, we want to use the **id** selector; so to select the id from the element, we need specify an `id` in our element:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">

<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Styling</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
</head>

<body>
    <h1 id="my-name">Hamid Alavi</h1>
</body>

</html>
```

In this example, we set `my-name` as an id for `<h1></h1>` element. We can adjust our CSS rules with `#` hashtag and the id name. For example:

```css
#my-name {
  color: blue;
}
```

Instead of selecting an element like `h1`, we select the id of that element (i.e. `my-name` selector). Now if we have multiple choices, we can't use id here, because it's just for one element. **We can use multiple id at the same time, but it's not a great choice. It's look like 5 persons have one identification**.

**Node**: `id` are useful for address bar in our page. Maybe someone wants to inspect our element and it's useful for these times.

Instead, we use `class` selector here; so to select the class from the element, we need specify a `class` in our element:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">

<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Styling</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
</head>

<body>
    <h1 class="main-element">Hamid Alavi</h1>
    <p class="main-element">Hamid Alavi</p>
</body>

</html>
```

In this example, we set `main-element` as a class for `<h1></h1>` and `<p></p>` elements. We can adjust our CSS rules with `.` dot and the class name. For example:

```css
.main-element {
  color: blue;
}
```

**Note1**: We recommend you to use **kebab-case** class name in your `class` naming, not the **camelCase or snakeCase**; because CSS is case-insensitive and you should avoid that and just focus on `kebab-case` like `.main-element`.

**Note2**: We recommend you to name your class by **feature or block/element name**, not by the **style** like `.blue-content`. Use it like `form-button` or `main-content`.

## Priority of Style

So in Cascading Style Sheets, cascading means that multiple rules can be applied to the same element; These rules may lead to conflicts. To reslove such conflicts, CSS knows a concept called **specificity** and there are clear rules included in the CSS specification; that define how such conflict should be resolved and which type of selector has a highter **specificity**.

In the other words:

- **Cascading**: Multiple rules can apply to the same element.
- **Specificity**: Resolve conflicts arising from multiple rules.

The highest priority in CSS style, is **inline style**. Then the `id` selector. After that, the `class` selector will be in order. In the other words:

Inline styles -> `#ID` selectors -> `.class` (and pseudo-class) and attribute selectors -> `<tag>` and pseudo-element selectors -> `*` wildcard

For example, consider this HTML content:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">

<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Styling</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
</head>

<body>
    <h1 class="main-element">Hamid Alavi</h1>
    <h1 class="main-element">Hamed Alavi</h1>
</body>

</html>
```

Then we can style those two headers (`h1`):

```css
h1 {
  background-color: lightgreen;
  color: red;
}

.main-element {
  color: blue;
}
```

As you can see, the color of texts keeps in blue even we changed them to red. Indeed, the color of those texts overwritten by the `.main-element` class. If we change the order (top to bottom) in CSS file like:

```css
.main-element {
  color: blue;
}

h1 {
  background-color: lightgreen;
  color: red;
}
```

we didn't see any changes in there. This is how priority and specificity are important.

## Inheritance

In CSS, **inheritance** controls what happens when no value is specified for a property on an element. CSS properties can be categorized in two types:

- **inherited properties**, which by default are set to the computed value of the parent element.
- **non-inherited properties**, which by default are set to initial value of the property.

Consider this HTML content and CSS code:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">

<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Styling</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
</head>

<body>
    <p class="main-element">My name is <b>Hamid Alavi</b></p>
</body>

</html>
```

```css
.main-element {
  background-color: yellow;
  color: red;
}
```

From **Styles** tab in the developer tool, as you can see, the style of `b` tag is inherited from `p` tag.

**Note**: The `inherit` keyword allows authors to explicitly specify inheritance. It works on both inherited and non-inherited properties (we don't want to cover it).

We can over overwrite the inherited syles:

```css
p {
  background-color: green;
}

b {
  background-color: yellow;
  color: red;
}
```

## Combinators

If we combine multiple selectors, it's so-called **combinators**, for example if we have this content:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">

<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Styling</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
    <script src="app.js" defer></script>
</head>

<body>
    <p class="color">My name is <b>Hamid Alavi</b></p>
</body>

</html>
```

Then we just want to style the bolded paragragh here:

```css
p b {
  background-color: yellow;
  color: red;
}
```

As you try it, just `Hamid Alavi` (or your name) is styled.

**Note**: The rule with more information like `p b {...`, wins over rules with less information like `h1` or just `p`. So the more specific rule has a higher specificity (priority).

**Important**: There is not inheritance happened, because we explicitly select the `b` tag from `p` tag.

## Combinator Types

There are four types for combinator in here:

- Adjacent Sibling
- General Sibling
- Child
- Descendant

> Adjacent Sibling

The adjacent sibling is added by adding a `+` plus between the selectors we want to combine, for example `div + p {..}`.

> General Sibling

This combinator is added by adding a `~` tilde sign between the selectors we want to combine, for example `div ~ p {..}`.

> Child

This combinator is added by adding a `>` greater than sign between the selectors we want to combine, for example `div > p {..}`.

> Descendant

This combinator is added by adding a **whitespace** between the selectors we want to combine, for example `div p {..}`. We used this combinator type in the previous example; i.e. `p b {..`, it's means that we selecting the `b` tag which includes in `p` tag.

## Combinator Types Examples

> Adjacent Sibling

Consider this content:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">

<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Styling</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
</head>

<body>
    <div>
        <h1>Hamid</h1>
        <h3>Hamed</h3>
        <h3>Ali</h3>
        <p>Reza</p>
        <h1>Mehrdad</h1>
        <h1>Morteza</h1>
    </div>
</body>

</html>
```

If we style them by:

```css
p + h1 {
  background-color: royalblue;
}
```

we see that the `Mehrdad` will be colored. Because the `h1` which contains `Mehrdad` is near the `p` tag. In the other words, the `p` is the neighbor of `h1` (brother or sister).

In this type:

- Elements share the same parent.
- Second element comes immediately after the first one.

> General Sibling

Consider this content:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">

<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Styling</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
</head>

<body>
    <div>
        <h1>Hamid</h1>
        <h3>Hamed</h3>
        <h3>Ali</h3>
        <p>Reza</p>
        <h1>Mehrdad</h1>
        <h1>Morteza</h1>
        <p>Majid</p>
    </div>
</body>

</html>
```

If we style them by:

```css
p ~ h1 {
  background-color: royalblue;
}
```

we see that the `Mehrdad` and `Morteza` are colored. Because all `h1` is near the `p` tag in the same level. For example, if we put the `<h1>Morteza</h1>` outside of the `div` tag, this will not be colored anymore. In the other words, the `p` is the home and all `h1` are family of that home or homemates.

In this type:

- Elements share the same parent.
- Second element comes after first element, but doesn't have to come directly after it.

> Child

Consider this content:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">

<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Styling</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
</head>

<body>
    <section>
        <h1>Hamid</h1>
        <h3>Hamed</h3>
        <h3>Ali</h3>
        <p>Reza</p>
        <div>
            <h1>Mehrdad</h1>
            <h1>Morteza</h1>
            <p>Majid</p>
        </div>
    </section>
</body>

</html>
```

If we style them by:

```css
div > h1 {
  background-color: royalblue;
}
```

we see that the `Mehrdad` and `Morteza` are colored. Because all `h1` in `div` tag will be included. In the other words, all `h1` tags are child of `div` tag and `div` tag is the parent of them.

In this type:

- Second element is a direct child of first element.

> Descendant (children)

Consider this content:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">

<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Styling</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
</head>

<body>
    <section>
        <h1>Hamid</h1>
        <h3>Hamed</h3>
        <h3>Ali</h3>
        <p>Reza</p>
        <div>
            <h1>Mehrdad</h1>
            <h1>Morteza</h1>
            <p>Majid</p>
        </div>
    </section>
</body>

</html>
```

If we style them by:

```css
section div {
  background-color: royalblue;
}
```

we see that all elements that included in `div` tag are colored. In the other words, all `div` tags are covered by `section` tag. The level on which we are, doesn't matter (direct or indirect child).

In this type:

- Second element is a descendant of the first element.

**Important**: Make sure you use a good combinator, because if you use the complex combinator, the performance maybe be affected. For example if you select an id or class selector, this is a good performance.

## Summary

|Selectors|Properties|Values|
|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|`div`|`background-color`|green|
|`this-color`|`color`|red|
|`#game-board`|`height`|100vh|
|`[draggable]`|`padding`|15px 10px|
|`*`|`display`|flex|

**Inheritance and Specifity**:

- Parent styles are generally inherited
- Multiple rules can apply to one element
- Specifity resolves **multiple rules** conflicts
- Inheritance defaults can be changed

**Selectors with Combinators**:

- **Adjacent Sibling**: `p + h1 { background-color: royalblue; }`
- **General Sibling**: `p ~ h1 { background-color: royalblue; }`
- **Child**: `div > h1 { background-color: royalblue; }`
- **Descendant**: `section div { background-color: royalblue; }`
