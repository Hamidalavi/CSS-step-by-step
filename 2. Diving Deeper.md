In this file, you will learn about:

- The Box Model
- Height & Width
- The `display` Property
- Pseudo Classes & Elements
- Grouping Rules
- More on Border
- Add Image as a Background

## Box Model

Every element in HTML is interpreted as a box by CSS. You can see the box in the browser developer tools. This is how CSS thinks about an element.

- Every element has a **content** (blue area), for example a `h1` tag has a text content.

- We could add a **padding** (green area) which is some internal space from the content to the next part (the border - light brown).

- We can add a **border** to each element. A border surrounds an element and directly comes after the padding which is turn comes directly after the content.

- Sometimes we want to have some spacing around an element and that would be the **margin** (brown area).

**Note**: Some elements like `h1` have a default margin in itself (`19.920px`).

## Working with Box Model

We can style an element with this box, for example consider this content:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">

<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Styling</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
</head>

<body>
    <h1>Hamid Alavi</h1>
</body>

</html>
```

We have an element here which is `h1` tag. We want to add padding, border and margin in our element:

```css
h1 {
  color: red;
  padding: 10px;
  border-width: 5px;
  border-color: black;
  border-style: solid;
  margin: 100px;
}
```

If you see the page, you see the styled element in here. We can use the shorthand of border style like this:

```css
h1 {
  color: red;
  padding: 10px;
  border: 5px black solid;
  margin: 100px;
}
```

**Note**: The `body` has `8x` margin in itself by default. We can remove the margin of body with:

```css
body {
  margin: 0;
}
```

## Margin Collapsing

If we got two elements next to each other, then margins between them are collapsed to one margin. The bigger margin wins. This is not a bug, this is on purpose. We can remove this state by `margin-top` and `margin-bottom` properties (for `h1` for example).

## Shorthand Properties

Shorthand properties are normal properties that combines the values of multiple other properties in a single property (the shorthand property). Consider this:

```css
h1 {
  border-width: 5px;
  border-color: black;
  border-style: solid;
}
```

We can write it like this:

```css
h1 {
  border: 5px black solid;
}
```

**Important1**: We also have `border-collapse` property which uses for border collapse state, for example one border or separated borders for every element. It uses in tables.

**Important2**: We also have `border-image` property which uses for border image, for example we want set our chicken image as border.

The order here doesn't matter. This will be interpreted in exactly the same way as it's in previous example. We also have a margin shorthand in here. Consider:

```css
h1 {
  margin-top: 2px;
  margin-right: 10px;
  margin-bottom: 2px;
  margin-left: 5px;
}
```

The shorthand of margin is abit different, for example:

```css
h1 {
  margin: 2px 10px 2px 5px;
}
```

This is one way of using shorthand for margin, the skeleton of this way is:

```css
h1 {
  margin: top right bottom left;
}
```

We can use the shorter way like this:

```css
h1 {
  margin: 2px 10px;
}
```

the skeleton of this way is:

```css
h1 {
  margin: top-bottom right-left;
}
```

We have lots of shorthands which we work with them. We cover them later.

## Width and Height

We can set the width of element with `width` property, for example:

```css
h1 {
  width: 100%;
}
```

It means that we tell it to take the full entire width of the page. You don't see a change, because all elements have `100%` by default (e.g. `h1`, `section` and `div`). They are block level element. We can reduce the width of that element with `width: 50%` (or 300px). The height is exactly the same. We can set the height for an element:

```css
h1 {
  background-color: red;
  width: 100%;
  height: 100px;
}
```

We set the `background-color` because you can see the height in element block (which comes from HTML block).

**Note**: If we set it to `100%` here, we don't see a change, because it's only as big as its content requires it to be (with parent height), for example consider this:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">

<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Styling</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
</head>

<body>
    <section>
        <h1>Hamid Alavi</h1>
    </section>
</body>

</html>
```

If we have a `section` which has a height of `300px` and if we set height of `100%` to `h1`, we see that the whole container (for `section`) will be affected:

```css
body {
  margin: 0;
}

section {
  height: 200px;
  background-color: yellow;
}

h1 {
  background-color: red;
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
}
```

If we reload the page, we see no `yellow` color in the page, because it covered by `h1` background-color which is `red`.

## Box Sizing

Consider this HTML content and CSS  code:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">

<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Styling</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
</head>

<body>
    <h1>Hamid Alavi</h1>
</body>

</html>
```

```css
h1 {
  background-color: red;
  width: 100%;
  height: 100px;
  padding: 10px;
  margin: 10px;
}
```

If we inspect the `h1` element, we see the `1536x100` for content. If we see the box model, we see that the **content** is `1536x100`. Because margin, border and padding don't affect and don't calculate with `h1` element. To calculate this condition we can use `box-sizing` property. The default value is `content-box`. We can include the border and padding with `border-box` value (target content, padding and border with our width and height assignments), for example:

```css
h1 {
  background-color: red;
  width: 100%;
  height: 100px;
  padding: 10px;
  margin: 10px;
  box-sizing: border-box;
}
```

With that, width and height include padding and border, it doesn't include the margin and we can't make it to include that. With this property, we'll have `1516x80` in `h1` element content. We can set this property for all elements with `*` universal selector:

```css
* {
  box-sizing: border-box;
}
```

## Another Example for `box-sizing`

Consider this HTML content:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">

<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Styling</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
</head>

<body>
    <div>Hamid</div>
</body>

</html>
```

```css
div {
  box-sizing: border-box;
  width: 500px;
  height: 500px;
  border: 50px black solid;
}
```

If we use `border-box` as value, width and height are include padding and border; for example, if we go to the DevTools in browser and change the border width, we see that the border width is increasing from inside. If we use `content-box`, then we see that the border width is increasing from outside of the content and they (padding and border) don't calculate with **content**.

## `display` Property

Let's see this HTML code:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">

<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Styling</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
</head>

<body>
    <header class="main-header">
        <div>
            <a href="index.html">Persian Sight</a>
        </div>
        <nav>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="packages/index.html">Packages</a></li>
                <li><a href="customers/index.html">Customers</a></li>
                <li><a href="contact-us/index.html">Contact us</a></li>
            </ul>
        </nav>

    </header>
</body>

</html>
```

We don't want this style, we want to list items near each other instead of column-in. Because the rendered as block. But `a` anchor tags are rendered in line (`inline`), for example:

```css
2x li

Hamid
Hamed
------
2x a

Hamid Hamed
```

We can change the their behavior with `display` property, for example we can use column-in `a` tags with `block` value:

```css
a {
  display: block;
}
```

Now all anchor tags will be rendered as block. We can remove these `a` tags from visible document flow (VDF) with `none` value:

```css
a {
  display: none;
}
```

As you can see, there is no more hyper link here. If we inspect elements, we see that this removed element is still part of the DOM (Document Object Model - see the **Elements** tab) but it's removed from visible document flow (as we can see).

We have another display which so-called `inline-block`. It's a great example for list items; it's a mixture of `inline` and `block` values, for example:

```css
li {
  display: inline-block;
}
```

As you can see, list items are in line and also in block level. We'll describe a better way of doing that with **flexbox** in later.

We can also put all elements in one line (`div` and `ul`) with (make sure I'm not teach this part):

```css
.main-header > div {
  display: inline-block;
  padding: 10px;
}

nav {
  display: inline-block;
}

li {
  display: inline-block;
  padding: 0 10px;
}
```

Then we want to move the list items (`li`s) to the right, to do this, we can use `text-lign` property:

```css
nav {
  display: inline-block;
  width: 100%;
}

ul {
  text-align: right;
}
```

As you can see, the are not in the one line. We can use some tricky ways for that, for example:

```css
* {
  box-sizing: border-box;
}

.main-header {
  background-color: lightgreen;
  width: 100%;
  padding: 10px;
  margin: 10px;
}

.main-header > * {
  display: inline-block;
  padding: 10px;
}

nav {
  width: 92%; /* or calc(100% - 10%) */
  text-align: right;
}

li {
  display: inline-block;
  padding: 0 10px;
}

a {
  width: 100px;
}
```

With this way, we can set them as one line. If we shrink our window, it's will be strange (with previous happens). We cover it in **responsive** file.

## Styling Anchor Tags

We can style our `<a>` tags with `text-decoration` property. Consider this HTML content:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">

<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Styling</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
</head>

<body>
    <header class="main-header">
        <nav>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="packages/index.html">Packages</a></li>
                <li><a href="customers/index.html">Customers</a></li>
                <li><a href="contact-us/index.html">Contact us</a></li>
            </ul>
        </nav>
    </header>
</body>

</html>
```

```css
.main-header a {
  width: 100%;
  text-decoration: none;
  color: red;
  font-weight: bold;
}
```

Let's describe these properties:

- width: Set width of anchor tag
- text-decoration: Set decoration of hyper links (default is `underline`)
- color: We set red color for these links
- font-weight: We make them bold

## Pseudo Classes and Pseudo Elements

We can change styles of anchor tags with hovering on them. We do that via pseudo classes; for example, for hovering event we want to style the `a` anchor tag:

```css
* {
  box-sizing: border-box;
}

.main-header {
  background-color: lightgreen;
  width: 100%;
  padding: 10px;
  margin: 10px;
}

nav {
  width: 100%;
  text-align: right;
}

li {
  display: inline-block;
  padding: 0 10px;
}

.main-header a {
  width: 100%;
  text-decoration: none;
  color: red;
  font-weight: bold;
}

.main-header a:hover {
  color: deeppink;
}
```

Let's see this part:

```css
.main-header a:hover {
  color: deeppink;
}
```

We tell CSS that when we hover on the hyper links, want to change the style of them (to pink). Indeed we add `hover` pseudo class here for `a` selector. This is just one of the pseudo class in here, we have lots of pseudo classes in CSS.

We have to differentiate between **pseudo classes** and **pseudo elements**:

- **Pseudo Classes**: Defines the style of a `special state` of an element.
- **Pseudo Elements**: Defines the style of a `specific part` of an element.

We worked with one of the pseudo classes in previous example which is `:hover`. Now we want to work with pseudo element here, for example we want to style the `specific part` of a `p` element:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">

<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Styling</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
</head>

<body>
    <p>Hamid Alavi is 23 years old (1997)</p>
</body>

</html>
```

We want to edit the first letter of this text:

```css
p::first-letter {
  color: red;
  font-size: 30px;
}
```

As you can see, the `H` is red and bigger than other letters.

You can also see pseudo classes and elements in [pseudo classes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Pseudo-classes) and [pseudo elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Pseudo-elements) links.

We can use pseudo element here, for example we want to add a content after and before `a` anchor tags:

```css
.main-header a::before {
  content: "(Before) ";
}

.main-header a::after {
  content: " (After)";
}
```

## Grouping Rules

If we have same styles in some rules (two or three and etc), we can group them by `,` comma, for example:

```css
.main-header a:hover,
.main-header a:active {
  color: deeppink;
}
```

Before, we must write styles like:

```css
.main-header a:hover {
  color: deeppink;
}

.main-header a:active {
  color: deeppink;
}
```

**Note**: We don't call it combinator, it's just grouping the rules.

## More on Border

We can add curve border with `border-radius` property, for example:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">

<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Styling</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
</head>

<body>
    <header class="main-header">
        <nav>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="packages/index.html">Packages</a></li>
                <li><a href="customers/index.html">Customers</a></li>
                <li><a href="contact-us/index.html">Contact us</a></li>
            </ul>
        </nav>
    </header>
    <p>Hamid Alavi is 23 years old (1997)</p>
    <a id="test" href="#">Hamid</a>
</body>

</html>
```

```css
#test {
  background-color: red;
  border: 2px black solid;
  border-radius: 30px;
  padding: 8px 16px;
}

#test:hover {
  background-color: deepskyblue;
  border-radius: 8px;
  border: none;
}
```

As you can see, the border is now rounded and it brings beautiful button for us.

## Add an Image to Background (Basic)

We can add a background image in our page with `background` property. We worked with this property for background colors, now we want to set an image; to do that, we have to use a `url` function which accept a string for path or URL, for example:

```css
body {
  background: url("https://www.humanesociety.org/sites/default/files/styles/768x326/public/2019/03/rabbit-475261_0.jpg?h=c855054e&itok=f-GfMm2M");
}

/* or */

body {
  background: url("rabbit.png");
}
```
